## Coding Style

### TypeScript

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation (no tabs).   <!-- o 4 se ci tieni -->
- Always end statements with semicolons `;`.
- Prefer double quotes `"` for strings (be consistent).
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions.
- Use `PascalCase` for components and classes.
- Prefer arrow functions for inline callbacks.
- Keep lines under 80 characters.
- Add a newline at the end of each file.

### Astro

- Use 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- Keep lines under 80 characters.
- Add a newline at the end of each file.
- Use the correct layout depending on the page type.
- Import only the components you actually use.
- Prefer Tailwind for styling; avoid unnecessary `.css` files.
- Keep imports organized and clean (put them in the frontmatters).

### Examples

❌ Wrong:

```ts
var my_var = "Hello world"
function my_function(){
    console.log("hi")
}
```

✅ Correct:

```ts
const myVar = 'Hello world';

function myFunction() {
  console.log('hi');
}
```
